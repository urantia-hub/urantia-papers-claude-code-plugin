# Urantia Papers plugin

Search and read the Urantia Papers, in English and Spanish, with the Bible and 21 other texts, from Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, or Codex. The plugin connects the hosted [urantia.dev](https://urantia.dev) MCP server and adds a research skill for well-cited answers. No key, no account, no local process.

## Install

Claude Code, as a plugin (the MCP server and the research skill):

```
/plugin marketplace add urantia-hub/urantia-papers-claude-code-plugin
/plugin install urantia-papers@urantia-papers
```

Claude Code, the MCP server only:

```
claude mcp add --transport http urantia-papers https://api.urantia.dev/mcp
```

Cursor: the repo is also a Cursor plugin (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`), listed at [cursor.directory/plugins/urantia-papers](https://cursor.directory/plugins/urantia-papers). Or add the server by hand, in Cursor or any client that reads an `mcpServers` config:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "urantia-papers": { "type": "http", "url": "https://api.urantia.dev/mcp" } } }
```

Gemini CLI: the repo is also a Gemini CLI extension (`gemini-extension.json`):

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/urantia-hub/urantia-papers-claude-code-plugin
```

ChatGPT: install the [Urantia Papers plugin](https://chatgpt.com/plugins/plugin_asdk_app_6ac15926d5388191a941565bfaaa2a9a).

The repo root is also a portable plugin package (`plugin.json`, `mcp.json`, `skills/`, `assets/`). Build the ZIP for the OpenAI plugin directory with `scripts/build-openai-zip.sh`.

Setup for other clients: [docs.urantia.dev/mcp-servers](https://docs.urantia.dev/mcp-servers).
